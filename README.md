## Currently project is in development process

#### About this project:
This project provide modern tool to autocomplete the words (and maybe whole phrases).
It's contain implementation of Trie and use AI/ML elements (KNN).
All is connnected with fastapi.

Project is in development.

#### TODO:

-> interface (React.js with CSS framework)

-> general unittest

-> cpp trie structure (DONE)

-> API test (cpp -> interface)

-> API integration (user -> cpp)

-> API integration (cpp -> python)

-> API integration (python -> interface)

-> KNN algorithm

#### How it works?
We use Trie to containerisation words.
Each node in Trie can suggest best matched word.
Data set is provided from English dictionary corpus and user input for training.

#### Tech stack:
python, cpp, fastapi
